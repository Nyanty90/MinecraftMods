# MinecraftMods
 A public repository of preferred resource/shader packs and mod dependencies for my servers; with its main purpose being a public archive for to-be and/or existing server members to refer to, and directly download required mods instead of me having to send them zipped files or links manually over Discord with its 8MB limit. And, I'm open to a better solution if you have one.
